# Notes App

Notes app with all the functionality built. 

You can add notes by pressing a button and then you'll be taken to another page where you can add a title and body to the note. 

There is live updating between different tabs. 

You can delete notes, search the your notes, and sort them by "last edited", "alphabetically", and "recently created".

Fun little project to work on my js.
